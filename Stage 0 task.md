FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT WITH CANCER

Recent advancements in cancer research have highlighted the crucial role of computational methods in understanding the biology of cancer and helps in accelerating clinical research and studies (Jiang et al., 2022). This is where Frontend development comes in.

Frontend development is gradually becoming a vital tool in cancer research for aiding in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients. This play a crucial role in cancer research, particularly in contributing to data visualization, public outreach, and patients’ engagement. Genetics plays a significant part in most cancers, necessitating the use of computer science techniques to analyze complex genetic data (Abdelrahman Hosny, 2017).

Cancer researchers often generate vast amounts of complex data, making it difficult for them to interpret and understand. Frontend developers can create interactive and visually appealing dashboards and visualizations that help researchers make sense of this data. Researchers can use frontend development to create visualizations showing cancer rates, susceptible genes, survivor rates across regions, races, or populations (Purushe et al., 2011). They can also create interactive maps illustrating relationships between genetic mutations and cancer outcomes or between a patient’s lifestyle, environment, and cancer outcomes.

Frontend development is also essential for creating platforms and tools which can improve patient engagement and understanding of their disease (Lai et al., 2019). It can also be used for public outreach and education on cancer by creating informative and engaging websites and mobile applications. This helps raise awareness about cancer, dispel myths, alleviate fears, and encourage early detection and prevention. Frontend development can create an appealing, user-friendly website that simplifies complex scientific information for a wider audience using infographics, cartoon characters, and other visual representations.

A good example of organization that has implemented frontend development is the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project (Tomczak et al., 2015), a collaborative effort to map genetic changes in various cancers, heavily relies on frontend development for data visualization and analysis. Interactive tools and databases developed by TCGA have significantly advanced cancer research. Similarly, another example is seen in the Patient Portal developed by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (McCleary et al., 2018). This online platform has provided patients with valuable resources like medical records and communication with their healthcare team. The use of frontend development, they have created a valuable resource for their patients, enhancing experience and outcomes.

Frontend development is a critical component of cancer research, enabling data visualization, patient engagement, and public outreach. By creating intuitive and user-friendly interfaces, frontend developers can help researchers make sense of complex data, improve patient experiences (Blanchard, 2023), and raise awareness about cancer.
