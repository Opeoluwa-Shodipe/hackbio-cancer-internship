\## \*\*CALCULATORS\*\*

\### \*\*Serial Dilution Calculator\*\*

This tool allows you to calculate the volumes needed to achieve specific concentrations through serial dilutions.

\*\*How to Use\*\*:

1\. Enter the Initial Concentration of the stock solution.

2\. Specify the Desired Final Concentration.

3\. Input the Dilution Factor (e.g., 1:10).

4\. Enter the Total Volume required for the dilution.

5\. Click \*\*Calculate\*\* to display the volume of stock solution needed at each dilution step.

\*\*Example\*\*:  

You want to create a series of 1:10 dilutions from a 100 mM stock solution to achieve 10mM. Input 1:10 as the dilution factor, 100mM as the initial concentration, 10mM as the final concentration, and 1mL as the total volume. Click \*\*Calculate\*\*, and the calculator will display the volume of stock solution needed at each dilution step.

\---

\### \*\*Stock Solution Calculator\*\*

This calculator helps determine the volume of a stock solution required to achieve a specific final concentration in a given volume.

\*\*How to Use\*\*:

1\. Enter the Concentration of the Stock Solution.

2\. Input the Final Desired Concentration.

3\. Specify the Final Volume needed.

4\. Click \*\*Calculate\*\* to get the volume of the stock solution needed, along with the amount of solvent required.

\*\*Example\*\*:  

To prepare 500 mL of a 0.1 M solution from a 1 M stock solution, input 1 M in the stock concentration field, 0.1 M in the final concentration field, and 500 mL in the total volume field. Click \*\*Calculate\*\*, and the calculator will show the volume of stock solution to use and how much solvent to add.

\---

\### \*\*Sedimentation Coefficient Calculator\*\*

This tool calculates sedimentation coefficients based on molecular weight and density.

\*\*How to Use\*\*:

1\. Enter the Molecular Weight of the molecule.

2\. Specify the Density of the Solvent.

3\. Input any additional parameters (e.g., temperature or viscosity).

4\. Click \*\*Calculate\*\* to display the sedimentation coefficient.

\*\*Example\*\*:  

If a macromolecule has a molecular weight of 300 kDa and moves at a velocity of 10 cm/s under 100,000 x g, the calculator will determine the sedimentation coefficient.

\---

\### \*\*DNA and RNA Concentration Calculator\*\*

This calculator helps determine the concentration of DNA and RNA based on absorbance values.

\*\*How to Use\*\*:

1\. Input the Absorbance (A260) for the nucleic acid.

2\. Specify the Dilution Factor, if applicable.

3\. Enter the Pathlength of the cuvette used in spectrophotometry.

4\. Click \*\*Calculate\*\* to determine the final DNA or RNA concentration in micrograms per milliliter (µg/mL).

\*\*Example\*\*:  

If you have an A260 reading of 0.8 and a dilution factor of 2, input 0.8 in the absorbance field and 2 in the dilution factor field. Click \*\*Calculate\*\* to get the DNA or RNA concentration in your sample.
