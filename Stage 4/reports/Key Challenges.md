### **Key Challenges Faced During This Project** ###

- Package Installation Issues: The large size of the required packages and unstable network connections in Nigeria frequently hindered the installation process which made the work slower and time-consuming.
- Version Compatibility Problems: Certain packages, such as TCG plots, required specific versions which necessitated upgrading to resolve compatibility issues. This was an issue that resulted in the R package being installed multiple times.
- Deployment Challenges: The large size of the packages consumed significant resources and time during the deployment of the Shiny dashboard.
- Package Conflicts: An old version of a package interfered with the deployment process, requiring deletion and re-installation.

Overall, this project was impacted by a combination of technical issues related to package installation, and network connectivity.
