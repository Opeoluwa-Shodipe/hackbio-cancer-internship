**Navigating the GO 1.0 App by Goal-getters team**

GO 1.0 is an interactive web-based application for gene-set enrichment analysis and visualization patterned after ShinyGO 8.0.

Below is a concise guide on how to navigating through it:

Upload Gene List:

Input Section: Users can upload a gene list or manually input gene symbols, IDs, or aliases. Supported species are selectable from a drop-down menu.

Options: Adjust enrichment analysis parameters, such as the significance level (FDR), the minimum/maximum pathway size, and the databases to search against (e.g., GO terms, KEGG pathways).

Results: Once genes are submitted, GO 1.0 automatically performs enrichment analysis, presenting the results as tables and plots.

Pathways and Processes: View enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms, pathways, biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components.

Visualization: Results are shown in bar plots and scatter plots, enabling users to explore relationships between genes and pathways.

Download Results: Users can download enrichment results and visualizations in various formats (e.g., CSV, PDF, PNG) for further analysis.

The GO 1.0 app is easy to navigate, with visualization and options to help users interpret and explore functional enrichment data.
