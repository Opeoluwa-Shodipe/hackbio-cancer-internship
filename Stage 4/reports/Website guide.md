## **Navigating the GO 1.0 App by the Goal-getters team**

ShinyGO 1.0 is an interactive web-based application for gene-set enrichment analysis and visualization patterned after ShinyGO 8.0.

Below is a concise guide on how to navigate through it:

---

## **HOME**

Welcome to ShinyGO 1.0, a user-friendly web-based platform for gene-set enrichment analysis. It features an easy-to-use interface, which offers customizable visualization options, and allows you to print results in either of the below formats CVS, PDF or PNG.

This platform provides valuable resources, including a guide on how to navigate through the website. This was developed as partial fulfillment of the HackBio internship program, GO 1.0 was patterned after ShinyGO 8.0 and this aims to simplify cancer gene-set enrichment analysis.

## **ABOUT**

**Initiation**

The R Shiny app dashboard project was initiated as part of a HackBio internship program, where participants were tasked with developing R Shiny dashboards for bioinformatics applications on Functional Enrichment analysis based on cancer genome atlas databases.


**Aims**

The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly website that simplifies gene set enrichment analysis while offering an intuitive interface for researchers. The ShinyGO 1.0 website will facilitate efficient data analysis and interpretation, thus contributing to the advancement of scientific research in genomics and related fields.

## **Upload Gene List**

**Input Section:** Users can upload a gene list or manually input gene symbols, IDs, or aliases. Supported species are selectable from a drop-down menu.

**Options:** Adjust enrichment analysis parameters, such as the significance level (FDR), the minimum/maximum pathway size, and the databases to search against (e.g., GO terms, KEGG pathways).

**Results:** Once genes are submitted, GO 1.0 automatically performs enrichment analysis, presenting the results as tables and plots.

**Pathways and Processes:** View enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms, pathways, biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components.

**Visualization:** Results are shown in bar plots and scatter plots, enabling users to explore relationships between genes and pathways.

**Download Results:** Users can download enrichment results and visualizations in various formats (e.g., CSV, PDF, PNG) for further analysis.

The ShinyGO 1.0 website is easy to navigate, with visualization and options to help users interpret and explore functional enrichment data.
