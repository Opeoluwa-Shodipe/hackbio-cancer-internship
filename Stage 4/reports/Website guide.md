## **HOME**

Welcome to GO 1.0, a user-friendly web-based platform for gene-set enrichment analysis. It features an easy-to-use interface, which offers customizable visualization options, and allows you to print results in either of the below formats PDF or PNG.

This platform provides valuable resources, including a guide on how to navigate through the website. This was developed as partial fulfillment of the HackBio internship program, GO 1.0 was patterned after ShinyGO 8.0 and this aims to simplify cancer gene-set enrichment analysis.

## **ABOUT**

**Initiation**

The R Shiny app dashboard project was initiated as part of a HackBio internship program, where participants were tasked with developing R Shiny dashboards for bioinformatics applications on Functional Enrichment analysis based on cancer genome atlas databases.


**Aims**

The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly website that simplifies gene set enrichment analysis while offering an intuitive interface for researchers. The GO 1.0 website will facilitate efficient data analysis and interpretation, thus contributing to the advancement of scientific research in genomics and related fields.
