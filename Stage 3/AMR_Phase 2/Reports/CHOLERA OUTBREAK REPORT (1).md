## **Overview**

This report presents an analysis of the cholera outbreak data downloaded from the World Health Organization (WHO) website. The data was cleaned, summarized, and visualized using R to identify trends and patterns.

---

## **Methodology**

Raw cholera outbreak data was downloaded from the World Health Organization (WHO) website, and three separate data sheets were obtained.

With the help of Excel functions, the three separate data sheets were combined into a single dataset.

The data was cleaned to remove inconsistencies and ensure accuracy and also summarized using R.

Moreso, Graphs were generated for easy visualization and also illustration of the key metrics for different trends, geographical distribution, and demographic impact.

A standardized template for documenting future cholera outbreaks was generated based on observations, ensuring consistency and ease of understanding.

---

## **Conclusion**

The project successfully integrated data collection, cleaning, analysis, and reporting, thereby providing a comprehensive overview of the cholera outbreak for informed decision-making.
