## **CALCULATORS**

The BioCal Calculator includes various tools to assist with common laboratory calculations.

### **Serial Dilution Calculator**
This tool calculates the volumes needed for specific concentrations via serial dilutions.

**How to Use**:
1. Enter the initial concentration of the stock solution.
2. Specify the desired final concentration.
3. Input the dilution factor.
4. Enter the total volume for the dilution.
5. Click **Calculate** to display the volume of stock solution needed.

**Example**:  
To create a 1:10 dilution from a 100 mM stock solution to achieve 10 mM, input the necessary values, and the calculator will display the required volumes.

### **Stock Solution Calculator**
This tool helps calculate the volume of stock solution required for a specific final concentration in a given volume.

**How to Use**:
1. Enter the stock solution concentration.
2. Input the final desired concentration.
3. Specify the final volume needed.
4. Click **Calculate** for the results.

**Example**:  
To prepare 500 mL of a 0.1 M solution from a 1 M stock solution, input the stock concentration, final concentration, and total volume. The calculator will provide the required values.

### **Sedimentation Coefficient Calculator**
This calculator determines sedimentation coefficients based on molecular weight and density.

**How to Use**:
1. Enter the molecular weight.
2. Specify the solvent's density.
3. Input any additional required parameters.
4. Click **Calculate** for the sedimentation coefficient.

### **DNA and RNA Concentration Calculator**
This tool calculates the concentration of DNA or RNA based on absorbance values.

**How to Use**:
1. Input the absorbance (A260) value.
2. Specify the dilution factor, if applicable.
3. Enter the pathlength of the cuvette.
4. Click **Calculate** for the final concentration.
